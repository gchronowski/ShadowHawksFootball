<h3>Round 1 — Loss vs. Jerknowitzki Shiners (105.54–119.24)</h3>
<div class="meta">Playoffs — Round 1</div>
<p>
       The ShadowHawks fought hard in the opening playoff round but came up short against the Shiners. Despite a strong offensive showing early, the team struggled to keep pace as the opposing quarterback surged late. Analysts pointed to missed red-zone opportunities and defensive breakdowns as key turning points. The coaching staff remains confident in the team's long-term direction and praised the resilience shown throughout the season.

<h3>Week 13 — Home Win over Jerknowitzki Shiners</h3>
<div class="meta">Week 13</div>
<p>
      The Shadowhawks came out on top against an underperforming Shiners offense. While Lamar Jackson lacked points, the other offensive and defensive players made up for it.

<h3>Week 12 — Bye Week</h3>
<div class="meta">Week 12</div>
<p>
       The ShadowHawks entered their third bye week of the season, using the time to reset and make key adjustments before the playoff push. Coaches emphasized recovery, refining offensive timing, and preparing for critical late-season matchups.

                <!-- WEEK 11 -->
                <article class="news-card">
                    <h3>Week 11 — Close Loss to Wilheimsburg Bighorns (114.42–114.84)</h3>
                    <div class="meta">Week 11 — Final score</div>
                    <p>
                        The ShadowHawks battled to the final whistle but fell short by a narrow margin. The defense forced several key stops throughout the second half, but an inability to sustain late drives prevented the offense from closing the gap. Coaching praised the team's effort while noting several areas — third-down execution and red-zone efficiency — to clean up ahead of the bye week.

                    <p>
                        The ShadowHawks were outpaced in Week 10 as the Foxhounds posted a dominant offensive performance. Turnovers and missed opportunities on special teams contributed to a lopsided result. Coaches indicated that the team will emphasize ball security and situational awareness in practice leading into the upcoming bye.

                        A balanced offensive effort lifted the ShadowHawks to a solid home victory. Multiple players contributed in both the passing and rushing attack; the defense made a late stand to preserve the lead. Team leaders credited preparation and situational planning for the win.

                        A late-game swing allowed the Tyrants to edge the ShadowHawks in a close contest. The coaching staff noted missed opportunities on short-yardage situations and late-game play-calling that will be reviewed in the film room.
